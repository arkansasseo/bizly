<p>Start with your video goals. Find your target audience. Now that you know where we&rsquo;re headed, we&rsquo;ll go into detail about how to execute each step.</p>
<p>Just like your website and broader social media efforts, you also need to track and analyze your results in order to maximize your video efforts. It's important to know that the time, effort and money you're investing into your video marketing strategy is achieving the goals that you identified when you started. A/b testing can be a great way to test which specific elements are working, and which are not.</p>
<p>Depending on your brand and its goals, there is no &ldquo;right&rdquo; channel to choose in terms of video content marketing. As a rule of thumb, you should strive to start and scale your video strategy wherever your existing social audience is. The benefits of this approach to video are two-fold: you already have a built in viewership and don&rsquo;t have to build a channel on another platform from scratch.</p>
<p>From brand videos to faqs to instructional videos and more, there are almost countless types of videos you can make in conjunction with your marketing funnel. Learn about them all by downloading our free ebook: 30 inspirational video ideas for your business ! despite there being so many, certain types of videos are better suited to meet your marketing goals. Once you&rsquo;ve got your goals strategized, you can start learning about how each video type differs and pick the ones that&rsquo;s right for you.</p>
<h2 id="2">What Kind of Video Should I Create?</h2>
<p>In the old model, no built-in mechanism exists to guide production of the right kind of content for a given goal. A good video strategy provides the guidance and a framework to create and distribute a powerful piece of content. It will also facilitate measuring the impact of that video. Objectives like &ldquo;educate our audience&rdquo; or &ldquo;raise awareness&rdquo; sound valid. But the lack of specificity is harmful because those objectives are next to impossible to measure accurately.</p>
<p>How can you optimize the video you already have? can you add a stronger call to action? can you share it on another platform? think creatively about how to further your video&rsquo;s reach and effectiveness. If you want more exposure, sharing your video on a new channel could help. If you&rsquo;re underwhelmed by your click-throughs or conversions, see if you can add an end card with a bigger cta, adjust the description copy, or create an incentive for clicking through, like a limited-time discount or some kind of contest.</p>
<p>Not many people will watch and share your videos if they don&rsquo;t offer anything useful or interesting. You need to create videos that provide your audience with what they want or like. When creating a video marketing strategy, you should: know who your target audience is. Understand what kind of information they are looking for. Identify topics that your audience will appreciate, like, share, and engage with.</p>
<p>Can videos be personalized? yes. Many brands have not yet adopted the personalized video marketing strategy. But for hyper-personalized, targeted content, we need to craft personalized and relevant messages. And hyper-personalized video marketing can elicit the right kind of emotional response from the consumers. We will see marketers using ai to understand customer preferences and create different creatives for different consumer bases and serve the relevant video to a targeted user base. Moreover, ai-driven analytics can help marketers understand the performance of different videos in real-time and tweak their video marketing strategy according to consumer preferences. With ai-driven video marketing, you can expect your branded videos to perform better and drive more conversions.</p>
<h3 id="3">Most Popular Types of Video</h3>
<p>How-to videos are the most popular type of video which customers love to consume and revolve around the educational concept to teach your audience in a step-by-step manner. These types of videos are compelling because they literally show you how to do something.</p>
<p>Online videos are an essential part for any business's content marketing because of its popularity across all age groups. Video is also widely shared on social media and via messaging apps, increasing the reach of your business information. Most importantly, video marketing is proven to improve leads and sales. Types of video you can create include explainer videos, branded videos, animated videos, and more. Video content marketing can be a challenge, but with the expert help of a video content marketer you can achieve the business benefits you want.</p>
<p>Reacting to the latest trends on social platforms can often mean standing out from the competition in the places your customers choose to spend their time. A great example of this is through live video or 360 degree video. Live video is a marketing method we have used to reach a larger audience across twitter, facebook, youtube and more. It allows us to interact with our audience immediately and keeps us front of mind for any potential opportunities. With 360 videos &ndash; we can offer a different perspective for clients. These types of videos are very popular for hotels and tourist sites &ndash; but do work well for any type of business.</p>
<p>Just like search algorithms sometimes favor videos over other other types of posts, so too do they favor videos with lots of views over those without many views. So making a video popular early on increases its chances of being popular for the long haul. But that&rsquo;s easier said than done. The best way to start your video off with plenty of views and likes is to stack the deck. Let your company employees, friends and family access it before the public launch so that your customers don&rsquo;t mistake your new video for an unpopular one.</p>
<h2 id="4">What Style of Video Should I Create?</h2>
<p>Before you dive into the world of video marketing, it&rsquo;s important that you start with a plan. I know, this section looks like the forced section of every guide-style article where you&rsquo;re told that you need to create a plan before you continue. But honestly? that&rsquo;s actually pretty good advice! the way i see it, any consistently effective marketing campaign is defined by consistent growth.</p>
<p>This is probably the first thing that comes to mind when you think of editing. Although the details vary depending on the software you&rsquo;re using, the basics are fairly standard. Editing software will allow you to arrange and cut video clips on a master timeline or sequence, usually by dragging and dropping files where you want them to appear. Add transitions and b-roll between clips the same way, to create a smooth, logical flow. Remember to keep transitions simple and relevant to the style of your video. They should glue everything together without standing out.</p>
<p>You need to make sure the agency you choose creates videos that will appeal to you and your audience. Choosing the best video marketing provider means taking a peek into their style, quality, and creativity to ensure their artistry is right for your needs.</p>
<p>Social content videos extended article why your company needs a social media video the combination of social media and video marketing is the most powerful way to reach potential customers. In the mid 2000s, numerous entertainment executives discovered&hellip; read more are short video clips created solely for social media platforms like facebook, instagram, twitter, linkedin, and more. These are usually fun, playful, engaging, and designed to be shared. They can include lifestyle shots, a montage of scenes relating to your product or service, short interview sound bites or quotes, or just a beautiful shot of your product.</p>
<h3 id="5">What Are the Three Stages of Video Production?</h3>
<p>The pre-production stage extended article everything you need to know about video pre-production pre-production is the first and one of the most important stages of the video production process. If you&rsquo;re thinking of hiring a video production&hellip; read more essentially covers all your video planning. It&rsquo;s the first and most important stage of the production process because it sets your entire video in motion. At this stage, you&rsquo;ll want to clearly define the content of your video, get feedback from all relevant team members, and start booking and scheduling your shoot. If you&rsquo;re hiring a production team or agency, you&rsquo;ll want to do all your company vetting, creative calls, and approvals here.</p>
<p>The other thing that will set the mood for your entire production? physical styling, including makeup, wardrobe, props, and set decorations. Whether you go big or go small, these things will communicate the bulk of your story. You should iron these out in the creative planning stages, though the specific details and purchases can come later. But how your video looks can deeply affect its success, so make sure your stylistic choices match the story you&rsquo;re telling and your ultimate marketing goals.</p>
<h3 id="6">How Does Video Improve My SEO?</h3>
<p>Because sites with video content perform better overall than sites that don&rsquo;t, search engines prioritize them. Ultimately, search engines want to do a good job, so if they see a website engages users, answers their questions, and provides a positive overall experience, they&rsquo;ll reward that site with a higher rank. Although tons of different things can help improve your seo, video specifically helps by:.</p>
<p>Ensure your video reaches the widest possible audiences with seo tactics that improve visibility and sharing across the web.</p>
<p>When you hear the term seo, what do you think about? written content, keywords, html formatting, pretty much anything that doesn&rsquo;t involve video, right? for a long time, it felt like seo and video marketing were completely separate concepts, but there are so many ways that video can improve your seo when done the right way. When you optimize your onsite seo, you work to create clean html structures with appropriate h1 tags and keywords on pages. Video optimization works the same way. It&rsquo;s important to make sure that you add the written transcription from your video and create relevant titles that are optimized for the type of traffic you&rsquo;re wanting to attract.</p>
<p>Again, there are tons of technical tips you can implement to improve your site&rsquo;s seo , but one of the best tips is to have high-quality content that educates and informs your viewer. And what&rsquo;s the most educational, informational form of content? video! if you&rsquo;ve already created your video, don&rsquo;t keep it to yourself. Video is by nature super informative, but the boost in seo it provides could pay off big in the long run.</p>
<p>If your website is filled with videos, but you&rsquo;re simply not ranking for them, there may be an issue with google&rsquo;s ability to evaluate the video content on your site. Solve that problem by creating a video sitemap. Google enabled sitemap protocol for video content in 2007. Creating a video sitemap will tell google precisely where all of your videos are located and what the content is in each video.</p>
<p>Videos allow you to increase the time spent by visitors on your site. Thus, longer exposure builds trust and signals search engines that your site has good content. Moovly gives us whopping statistics: you&rsquo;re 53 times more likely show up first on google if you have a video embedded on your website. Since google now owns youtube, there has been a significant increase in how much videos affect your search engine rank.</p>
<p>The purpose of the video is to get people to visit your website. Always include a link back to your main website, product or service page when posting a video. Links can be shown directly in the video or it can be added to the video description. We recommend doing both. Adding your website link to the video description also generates social signals on many platforms and it increases your search engine ranking on google, bing search and similar sites. By posting your website link along with your video, people can see that a youtube channel, a twitter handle, facebook page and a website are all related.</p>
<p>You may already be familiar with seo for blog content or website copy, this is no different. Your video needs to include keywords you want to rank highly for. Just like the title or h1 tag of a web page, the title of your video is one of the most important factors for ranking well on google and youtube. You should try to include your main keyword in your title and keep it under 66 characters so that the text isn&rsquo;t&nbsp;truncated in search results.</p>
