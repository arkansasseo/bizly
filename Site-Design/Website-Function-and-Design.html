		  <h1>And so, let me ask you, what's the primary purpose of a website?</h1>
<p>For what reasons are you using content marketing? for it to succeed, you need to define your goals and objectives first. Maybe you want to improve your website&rsquo;s search rankings, or perhaps you are trying to attract customers and drive sales. <img style="max-width: 20%; margin: 3px;" src="https://806169.smushcdn.com/1596018/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/aviapark2.png?lossy\u003d1\u0026strip\u003d1\u0026webp\u003d1" alt="website" align="left" /> Keep in mind that you can have multiple goals and objectives for content marketing. If generating sales is your primary aim, increasing brand exposure may be a secondary goal. In this case, you should reinforce your brand by mentioning it several times throughout your content.</p>
